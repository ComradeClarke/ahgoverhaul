POLITICS_TRIBAL_LEADERSHIP_DESC:0 "This area of land is not ruled over by any centralized state, and its people are very technologically backward compared to the world's Great Powers. The most powerful form of authority in this area is the chief of a small tribe."
POLITICS_COLLECTIVE_LEADERSHIP_DESC:0 "The centralized state that once controlled this area has collapsed. The population now govern themselves in a form of communal leadership, bartering with other communes for needed resources. The most powerful form of authority in this area is the council of a small farm or factory."
POLITICS_COMPANY_LEADERSHIP_DESC:0 "The centralized state that once controlled this area has collapsed. The task of governing has now been taken up by large businesses, bartering with each other for needed resources. The most powerful form of authority in this area is the board of a company."

### GERMANY ###
POLITICS_GER_NATSOC_DESC:0 "Adolf Hitler is the Führer and Reichskanzler of the Third German Reich, an authoritarian regime ruled by the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). The NSDAP pioneered the National Socialist ideology, in which the state exercises totalitarian control of its population and economy, for the purposes of united the people of a chosen race (at the cost of those deemed as lesser or unworthy).\n\nOutside Germany, Hitler is one of the most polarizing figures of the era, revered as a visionary and unifier by ethnic Germans, and reviled as a warmonger and virulent anti-Semite by most of the left in equal measure. Within the borders of the German Reich, Hitler is almost unanimously regarded as the leader needed to return Germany to greatness, in a personality cult matched by few. The fact that political dissidents often disappear before they can cause trouble for the Regime certainly plays a large part in this..."
POLITICS_GER_THEOC_DESC:0 "Heinrich Himmler rose to notoriety in German society as Reichsführer of the Schutzstaffel, a paramilitary orgnization originally formed to provide security for members of the NSDAP.\n\nAfter Himmler gained power of the organization, the Schutzstaffel eventually grew to become Germany's largest security and surveillance agency, responsible for supressing sedition and \"removing\" undesirable members of society. Now, however, as the Sonnenrad replaces the Swastika as the symbol of German racial supremacy, Himmler has expanded the role of the Schutzstaffel to an unprecedented degree.\n\nHimmler, a lifelong believer in the occult, has formed his Fourth Reich into a quasi-religious state, implementing elements of neopaganism in an effort to ensure the dominance of the German race, though the one thing worshipped above all else in Ordenstaat-Deutscheland is Order. Every German citizen now lives under the unblinking eye of the Schutzstaffel, and any deviations from Himmler's desired ideals of the perfect Aryan will bring down the ire of the Gestapo.\n\nThough the dissapearances are becoming ever more common, and eugenics and phrenology are once again considered core scientific concepts, the German people are forced to accept their new reality, for there is one universal truth held above all others in Himmler's Germany: There is no leaving the Ordenstaat."
POLITICS_GER_REPFASH_DESC:0 "Otto Strasser is a former member of the NSDAP, who split with the party in 1930 over economic disagreements. Though Strasser and Hitler both share a hatred of capitalism, believing it to be an international Jewish conspiracy, Hitler was open to compromise in order to avoid unnecessary conflict.\n\nWhere Hitler agreed to let German business owners who cooperated with the state's requests be, and mainly focused on nationalizing the businesses of Jews and political opponents, Strasser called for a \"second revolution\" to remove the elites of German society from their positions. This view was shared by Ernst Röhm of the Sturmabteilung, who was murdered on Hitler's orders in 1934.\n\nAfter being expelled from the NSDAP, Strasser founded the Black Front, which managed to stage a coup against Hitler shortly after his attempt to consolidate power."
POLITICS_GER_CENMON_DESC:0 "August Wilhelm I, first Kaiser of the German Confederation, is the fourth son of Wilhelm II. After the German Empire was defeated in the Great War, the Entente debated on on how to prevent another war.\n\nOne plan brought forward by the British was to crown August Wilhelm as Kaiser, or as Regent for a younger Prince, due to their belief that he could be controlled. Thus, the German Confederation was created, as a constitutional federal monarchy stylized after the British Dominions.\n\nThough democracy has survived the first two decades of the Confederation's existence, many politicians fear that August Wilhelm is not as complacent as he appears, and that he may try to reclaim Germany's place in the sun from those that crowned him."
POLITICS_GER_FASCISM_DESC:0 "August Wilhelm I is the fourth son of Kaiser Wilhelm II, recently crowned as the ruler of a new German Empire. During the interregnum, August Wilhelm rose to prominence as a fierce nationalist, allying himself with the NSDAP under the belief that they might reward him with a restoration to the German throne.\n\nThis belief ultimately turned out to be unfounded, as the NSDAP used him to gain votes and abandoned him following the Night of the Long Knives. Despite this, August Wilhelm stayed true to his beliefs in National Socialism, and when the NSDAP collapsed August Wilhelm was more than happy to accept the new government's offer to return to the throne."
POLITICS_GER_STRATMON_DESC:0 "Ludwig Beck is the Regent of the German Provisional Government, established after a military coup that deposed Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP.\n\nThe coup, intended to prevent Germany from entering into a war it could not win, was planned by Beck and Hans Oster of the Abwehr, with the support of several other members of the military and civilian government.\n\nSince gaining power, the provisional government has made efforts to restore ties with the west and dismantle the massive societal influence of National Socialism. Chief among Beck's responsibilities is maintaining unity amongst the Provisional Government, a broad political coalition united only by its opposition to the NSDAP. Though Beck and most of his cabinet seek a restoration of the monarchy, political pressure has thusfar prevented a decision from being made as to the future of Germany, so the Provisional Government endures."
POLITICS_GER_STRAT_DESC:0 "Walther von Lüttwitz, chief of the German Military Junta, rose to power in the Kapp–Lüttwitz Putsch of 1920 that deposed the civilian government of the Weimar Republic and established an authoritarian regime.\n\nThe Putsch, supported by a large coalition of conservatives, nationalists, monarchists, and members of the Reichswehr, gave Lüttwitz control of the German Military and placed Wolfgang Kapp in charge of the civilian government.\n\nAfter Kapp's death, Lüttwitz assumed control of the government, staffing it with generals loyal to him, and transforming the German Republic into a military dictatorship."
POLITICS_GER_VAN_DESC:0 "Ernst Thälmann is the Chairman of the State Council of the German Soviet Republic, and one of the country's most notorious revolutionaries. In 1918, he deserted from the army to participate in the German Revolution of 1918, becoming a founding member of the KPD two years later.\n\nIn 1923, he helped organise the Hamburg Uprising, which helped him rise to party leadership despite its failure. Thälmann, a committed Stalinist, allied the KPD with the USSR, and managed to secure funding from the Soviet Government, enabling the party to expand its various paramilitary organisations.\n\nAfter the Reichstag fire of 1933, Adolf Hitler persuaded President Hindenburg to suspend the Weimar Constitution's provisions on civil liberties, in an effort to combat alleged communist violence. When the repression of KPD members began, Thälmann - with support from the USSR - managed to orchestrate yet another uprising, with far more success.\n\nThälmann's final uprising managed to mend the divide between the KPD and moderate socialists, who feared that they may be the government's next target, and together they managed to overthrow the Weimar government.\n\nWith the capitalists removed from power, Thälmann turned on his socialist allies, cementing Stalinist doctrine as the main political force in Germany for the foreseeable future.
POLITICS_GER_COM_DESC:0 "Otto Rühle, General Secretary of the German Commune, has been a believer in Marxist principles for longer than many people have been alive. A strict pacifist, Rühle opposed both the Great War, and the authoriarian communism of the USSR and Thälmann's KPD.\n\nAfter the German Communist Revolution of 1933, Rühle feared he would be targetted by the KPD for his more liberal views, and was forced into hiding, where he began a campaign of opposition against the Stalinist regime. Eventually, Thälmann's persecution of moderate socialists, and accusations that he was nothing more than a Soviet puppet, turned the bulk of German communists against him, and the KPD was overthrown in late 1935.\n\nRühle was chosen as the new leader of a more decentralised and free communist state, though keeping it united may prove to be difficult, as the Soviet Union has not taken kindly to the removal of their western ally..."
POLITICS_GER_SOC_DESC:0 "Otto Wels is the President of the German Republic, and chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The SDP has held the most seats in the Reichstag of any individual party since the German Revolution of 1918, but have only spend a few years in power due to various coalitions and minority governments supported by President Hindenburg being appointed.\n\nIn the 1933 elections, the SDP managed another unlikely victory, managing to win more seats than the popular NSDAP, and Hindenburg was forced to make a difficult decision. The old President eventually conceded to the SDP, and after a second failed Nazi Putsch, social democracy has managed to endure in the Republic."
POLITICS_GER_MONSOC_DESC:0 "Viktoria is the first Kaiserin Regnant of Germany, after changes to the succession law allowing female inheritence were agreed upon between the SDP and Kaiser Wilhelm II following the German Revolution of 1918. Rather than abolish the monarchy entirely, the SDP recognised its usefulness as a unifying factor, and decided to reform and modernize the institution while removing many of its powers.\n\nAs part of this, the German Empire was decentralized, with more power being handed out to the various Kingdoms and Duchies. Though Viktoria enjoys universal popularity throughout the United Kingdoms, she is little more than a figurehead for the SDP."
POLITICS_GER_AUTHMON_DESC:0 "Wilhelm II von Hohenzollern has ruled the German Empire since 1888, making him the longest-reigning current monarch in Europe. Though Wilhelm has delegated much of the running of the Empire to his government, he still possesses many powers, and will not hesitate to act without the support of the Reichstag.\n\nThough Germany has been rocked by crisis several times during his reign, Wilhelm has endured them all, and the sun will likely never set on the German Empire as long as he still lives."
POLITICS_GER_ABSMON_DESC:0 "Wilhelm II von Hohenzollern was first crowned Kaiser in 1888, though his reign was not without crisis. In 1918, with the Great War almost lost, Wilhelm was forced to abdicate, and spent the next four years in exile in the Netherlands.\n\nAfter the death of Wolfgang Kapp, who had overthrown the German goverment in 1920, a large monarchist movement invited Wilhelm to return to Germany, to prevent Walther von Lüttwitz from establishing another military dictatorship. Since his restoration, Wilhelm II has centralized as much power to himself as possible, believing that the Great War was lost after he delegated much of it to his advisors.\n\nThough the new Empire has been weakened considerably, only time will tell if Wilhelm is able to reclaim the Germany's place in the sun, or if his second reign will be as disastrous as his first."
POLITICS_GER_CONREP_DESC:0 "Hermann Drewitz is the current President of the Weimar Republic, having been chosen for the position after the death of Paul von Hindenburg. His party, the Business Party, gained power due to their support of Hindenburg's Presidency, and became more prominent in German politics as a result.\n\nPrior to his political career, Drewitz was a rather skilled baker, who had also fought in the Great War."
POLITICS_GER_LIBREP_DESC:0 "Hermann Dietrich is the current President of Germany, having been chosen for the position after the death of Paul von Hindenburg.\n\nDietrich is a member of the Deutsche Staatspartei, and previously served as Finance Minister from 1930-1933, where he advocated for the use of lower-wage government contracts as a method of reducing unemployment. "
POLITICS_GER_CENREP_DESC:0 "Ludwig Kaas is the current Minister-Primate of the Confederation of the Rhine, having been chosen for the position after the Centre Party won a majority in the Diet of the Confederation.\n\nThe Confederation, once a loose collection of protectorates overseen by the Bonapartist Emperors of France, has changed considerably in the 130 years since its creation. In an effort to reduce the risk of revolt, the French granted self-government to the Confederation in 1871, now a more centralized union with an elected head of state (though the individual states were allowed to choose whether or not to retain their monarchs).\n\nKaas, a Catholic Priest, had previously been instrumental in the signing of a concordat between the Confederation and the Holy See. He also gained notoriety for his strongly-held beliefs that the Rhineland was an integral part of the Confederation, which many French-aligned politicians saw as controversial. As an unusual choice for the Confederation's leadership, it remains to be seen what his rule will bring."
POLITICS_GER_AUTHREP_DESC:0 "Kuno von Westarp is the current President of the German Reich, seizing power after the death of Wolfgang Kapp. Westarp, a former judge, was involved in the planning of the Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch, and became an influential member of Kapp's cabinet. During Kapp's brief rule of Germany, the German National People's Party was made the sole legal party, and the Reichswehr played a key role in the governing of the country.\n\nAfter Kapp's death, Lüttwitz tried to consolidate power and create a military dictatorship, but a general strike of the bureaucracy made it impossible for him to govern. Lüttwitz eventually made the decision to resign, leaving Westarp in charge of the civilian government, a role he has filled for the past 14 years."
POLITICS_GER_CONMON_DESC:0 "Wilhelm III von Hohenzollern ascended to the German throne after the death of his father, Kaiser Wilhelm II. Since his ascension to the throne, Wilhelm III has delegated many of his powers to the Reichstag, becoming more similar to the constitutional monarchs of western Europe.\n\nThe Konservative Volkspartei are in currently in power, and Wilhelm III enjoys widespread popularity both in Germany and abroad."
POLITICS_GER_LIBMON_DESC:0 "Wilhelm I von Hohenzollern, son of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, was crowned Emperor of the new Holy Roman Empire by German monarchists following the Anschluss of Austria. With the Haus von Habsburg-Lothringen no longer in power following the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, Wilhelm I faced little opposition to his sudden rise to power.\n\nDespite his new title being seen as somewhat archaic, Wilhelm I has proved to be a remarkably modern ruler, with much of the Empire's governance left to the civilian government of the Deutsche Volkspartei."
