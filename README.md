5) Hold control, and click the folder and the .MOD file and press copy
6) Go to documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron 4/mod and paste it into the mod folder.
7) Boot up HOI4, select aHistoric Geographical Overhaul - Development Version and activate the mod.

---------------
Extra notes:

- the reason why you have to rename the folder to ahgoverhaul is because the game won't read the mod folder if it isn't the same name as the .MOD file.
- don't expect every version to not be a buggy mess. as OCD-pleasing the mod may be, it's not bug-pleasing.
