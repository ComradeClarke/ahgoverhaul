This is a folder with all the programmes I recommend for working on HGO. If you are not a developer, then just ignore this folder. This folder has the following:

- DropIt (used for automatically moving files from Paradox\HOI4\History\States to Paradox\HOI4\Mods\ahgoverhaul\history\states) [Optional, ASK CASS IF YOU NEED HELP]

- Github Desktop (used to keep HGO files the same across all developers, and also provide a convenient way to allow fans to download the mod) [REQUIRED, LOCATED IN .RAR FILE]

- ImageMagick (used to make the bat files for resizing flags functional) [Recommended, ASK CASS IF YOU NEED HELP]

- Notepad++ (used to more conveniently edit text files, and has way more features than standard notepad) [REQUIRED]

- PaintDotNet (PDN) (used to edit .dds and .bmp files, basically a free version of Photoshop) [Recommended, ASK NOZZA IF YOU NEED HELP]

- SageThumbs (program that allows you to see .tga and .dds files as thumbnails in Windows Explorer) [REQUIRED]

- WinRAR (probably the best compressed file opener ever.) [NEEDED TO OPEN GITHUBDESKTOPSETUP.RAR]

If you have any questions, contact me on Discord at Cass#6058

If you have Mac or Linux, use google to find the right executables for the listed programs. Or just, y'know, get a fucking PC.


Good luck!
