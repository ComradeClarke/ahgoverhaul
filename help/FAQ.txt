Q: What version of the game is this for?
A: HGO works for 1.9(.2) now.

Q: Some nations have no flag.
A: The anarchy releasables lack a flag deliberately due to not being countries. In addition, some newly-added releasables may not have a flag, either due to them not having one
   or because they have not been added yet. If a country that exists by default has no flag, you may have a missing file or some form of glitch, so you should reinstall the mod
   before bringing the missing flag to the attention of the developers.
