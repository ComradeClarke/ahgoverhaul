Q: What version of the game is this for?
A: Currently, HGO only works with version 1.8.2. The chance of it working in 1.9 is neglible.

Q: Some nations have no flag.
A: Some countries did not have a national flag in 1936. These include Ethiopia, Bhutan, and (etc?). Most anarchy releasables also lack a flag deliberately, due to not being
   countries. If you want a national flag for the nations that historically lacked them, (not added yet:) you can switch them to Monarchism.
